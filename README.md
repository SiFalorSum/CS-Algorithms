# CS Algorithms

_by Nils Hansander (2022)_

## Project's Purpose

The purpose of this project has simply been for me to practise implementing various sorting and search algorithms, to make me improve as a developer and to work as a showcase of a variety of algorithms.

## Disclaimer

The algorithm implementations are provided as-is, with no purport as to being the most effective, scalable solutions. Some unit testing has been implemented, but I can leave **no** guarantee to the code being safe or behave predictably in every possible scenario. If you use the code in this repository, **you do so at your own risk**. See also `LICENCE.md` in this repository.

### Installation

- Clone this project to your system and open up a terminal to the root directory of the project.
- Run `npm ci` to install the project and its dependencies.

### Scripts

- Run `npm run build` to compile the typescript source files in the _src_ directory, and then run unit tests.
- Run `npm run test` to run unit tests only.
- Run `npm run demo` to see the algorithms in action using example data.
